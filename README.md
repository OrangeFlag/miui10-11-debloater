# Miui 10/11 debloater for Xiaomi devices

I wrote this script to remove all kinds of useless Xiaomi apps and services that come pre installed on Miui 10/11 devices. It removes things like second space, quick ball, app vault and all Xiaomi apps that can be replaced with Google ones.

**Use at your own risk**

## Ubuntu

Install [Android Debug Bridge (adb)](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb):

```bash
  sudo apt install adb
```

Rename *miui-debloater.cmd* to *miui-debloater.sh* and run it:

```bash
  bash './miui-debloater.sh'
```
